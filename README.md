Miscelanous tools I wrote.

 e15-downloader.py - simple Python2 tool that downloads E15 magazine sent by email and uploads to Dropbox using [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) script. Useful together with [FolderSync](http://www.tacit.dk/foldersync) Android app that downloads it to tablet for convenient read.
