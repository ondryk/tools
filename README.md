Miscelanous tools I wrote.

e15/e15-downloader.py - simple Python2 tool that downloads [E15 magazine](http://www.e15.cz) sent by email and uploads to Dropbox using [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) script. Useful together with [FolderSync](http://www.tacit.dk/foldersync) Android app that downloads it to tablet for convenient read. Settings for this tool are available directly in the script itself.
