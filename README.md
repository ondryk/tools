# tools
Miscelanous tools I wrote for various reasons.

 - e15/e15-downloader.py - simple Python2 tool that downloads E15 magazine and makes it available to Dropbox. See readme here.
 - ifauna-watcher/if-watch.ru - simple script that checks new advertisements on iFauna server and sends email notifications.
