#E15 downloader

This is simple Python2 script for downloading [E15 magazine](http://www.e15.cz) received by email and uploads it to Dropbox using [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) script. Useful together with [FolderSync](http://www.tacit.dk/foldersync) Android app that downloads it to tablet for convenient read. Settings for this tool are available directly in the script itself as it is very simple. 

To make it work, just clone the repo and edit python script for settings. It is necessary to have the E15 emails filtered to separate IMAP folder as this script searches for latest email there.
